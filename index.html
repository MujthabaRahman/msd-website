          <h1>who is Ms Dhoni?</h1>
          <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni (born 7 July 1981), is a former international cricketer who captained the Indian national cricket team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. He is currently the captain of Chennai Super Kings (CSK), a franchise based team of Indian Premier League. Having won the triple ICC limited-overs tournament as captain (inaugural 2007 ICC World Twenty20, 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and 2013 ICC Champions Trophy) and brought the Indian cricket team to number one position in ICC test rankings in 2009, Dhoni is often considered as the greatest captain of Indian cricket team. Furthermore, he led CSK to win 2010, 2011, 2018 and 2021 edition of IPL, becoming second most successful IPL captain after Rohit Sharma.
            Dhoni made his ODI debut on 23 December 2004 against Bangladesh, and played his first Test a year later against Sri Lanka. In 2007, he took over the ODI captaincy from Rahul Dravid. In test cricket his captaincy record was mixed, successfully leading India to series win against New Zealand (in 2009) and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy (home series in 2010 and 2013) against Australia while losing to Sri Lanka, Australia, England, and South Africa by big margins in away conditions. He announced his retirement from Tests on 30 December 2014 and captain of limited-overs game in 2017.
            On 15 August 2020, Dhoni retired from International Cricket.Dhoni was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand), and hails from a Hindu Rajput family. His paternal village Lwali is in Jainti tehsil, Lamgara block of the Almora District of Uttarakhand. Dhoni's father is Pan Singh and his mother is Devaki Devi. His parents moved from Uttarakhand to Ranchi, Jharkhand where his father Pan Singh worked in junior management positions[specify] in MECON. He has a sister Jayanti Gupta and an elder brother Narendra Singh Dhoni. His uncle, Pan Singh's brother, Ganapat Singh Dhauni lives in Lwali. Dhoni's uncle and cousins spell their surname as Dhauni but Mahendra Singh spells his as Dhoni.
            Dhoni's mother tongue is Bhojpuri and he also speaks Tamil.
            He is a fan of Adam Gilchrist, and his childhood cricket idol was his former team-mate and former cricketer, Sachin Tendulkar. Since childhood his favourite Bollywood actor is Amitabh Bachchan and favourite singer is Lata Mangeshkar
            He was a goalkeeper for his football team[which?] and was sent to play cricket for a local cricket club[which?] by his football coach. Though he had not played cricket, he impressed with his wicket-keeping skills and became the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando cricket club (1995–1998). Based on his performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship and he performed well. Dhoni focused on cricket after his tenth standard.</p>

        <div class="victory-card">
          <h1>Fastest to reach No. 1 of ICC ODI Rankings</h1>
          <p>Thanks to his inning of 148 against Pakistan and 183 against Sri Lanka, MS Dhoni quickly made a name for himself in ODI cricket. Despite floating around in the batting order, the hard hitting batsman was performing at almost every position. And it showed in his ICC ODI rankings when he became the No. 1 batsman just after 42 innings</p>
        </div>
        <div class="victory-card">
          <h1>Most ODI Games finished with a Six</h1>
          <p> Dhoni and finishing games off with a six – a better love story than most of the Bollywood movies. So in yet another unsurprising record, ‘The Finisher’ has finished NINE ODI games with a six, more than anyone else.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="victory-card">
          <h1>Only Player to win the World Cup with a Six</h1>
          <p>In the 11 World Cup played so far, four of them have been won by the team batting second. And on 2nd April 2011, not only did India chase the highest total in the history of World Cup finals, but MS Dhoni became the only batsman to win the World Cup with a six.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="victory-card">
          <h1>Most Stumpings in International Cricket</h1>
          <p>Dhoni has 38 stumpings in test cricket, 120 in ODI and 33 in T20 internationals. And looking at these numbers, it is safe to say that his record in ODIs and tests will be a difficult one to break for a long time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="victory-card">
          <h1>Most Successful Indian wicket-keeper</h1>
          <p>The unorthodox wicketkeeper has 294 dismissals in tests, 434 in ODIs and 87 in T20 internationals. His tally in the shortest format of the game is also a world record, with no other wicketkeeper anywhere near him.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="victory-card">
          <h1>First Player to pass 10,000 ODI runs with 50+ average</h1>
          <p>Dhoni has scored 10,000 plus runs in ODI cricket. He is one of the only 14 players to do so, and the very first one to it with a 50+ average. And this record becomes even more amazing when you think of the names who have scored 10,000 plus runs – Tendulkar, Sangakkara, Pointing and many more legends.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="victory-card">
          <h1>Most T20 International wins as captain</h1>
          <p>MS Dhoni became the first captain to lift the T20 World Cup back in 2007 and he continued to boss that field for a long time. Dhoni is the most successful T20I captain with 41 wins in a record 72 matches led.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="victory-card">
          <h1>Most Successful IPL Captain</h1>
          <p>Rohit Sharma recently became the first captain to lift the IPL trophy four times, moving ahead of MS Dhoni, who has won the tournament thrice. But the Thala, as he is famously called in Chennai, is the most successful IPL captain of all time. Dhoni has won 104 IPL matches with 60% wins. He is also the only captain to cross the 100 mark in wins.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="victory-card">
          <h1>First Captain to take India at No. 1 in Tests</h1>
          <p>India are the current No. 1 side in the test cricket, courtesy a historic win in Australia. But that wasn’t always the case for Indians in the red-ball cricket. In fact, MS Dhoni was the first captain to lead India to the top of the ICC test Rankings back in 2009. He also became the first Indian to lift the famous ICC Test Championship Mace.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="victory-card">
          <h1>Most Matches as Captain</h1>
          <p>Starting with the T20 World Cup triumph in 2007, Dhoni finally decided to step down as the captain of India in 2017. In his long and successful career as a captain, Dhoni has led India on 332 occasions in all three formats.The Captain Cool has led India in 60 tests, 200 ODIs and 72 T20Is. He broke Ricky Ponting’s record of 324 in August 2016.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="victory-card">
          <h1>Most Successful Indian Captain in all three formats:</h1>
          <p>Arguably the best Indian captain in the history, MS Dhoni has the stats to show that he is indeed the most successful Indian captain. Dhoni has won the most number of matches as the captain of India in all three formats. 27 in testes, 110 in ODI and 41 in T20I.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="victory-card">
          <h1>Only Captain to win all three ICC Trophies:</h1>
          <p>Dhoni’s young team led India to success in the first ever T20 World Cup in 2007. Dhoni himself played a match winning knock in the final of the 2011 World Cup to lift the World Cup. And he completed the Treble by lifting the Champions Trophy in 2013.</p>
